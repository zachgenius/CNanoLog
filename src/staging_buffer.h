/**
 * Staging buffer size per thread.
 *
 * Tuning guidelines:
 * - 1MB (default): Good for steady logging, ~250K logs buffered
 * - 4MB: Good for moderate bursts, ~1M logs buffered
 * - 8MB: Good for heavy bursts, ~2M logs buffered
 * - 16MB+: For extreme burst scenarios
 *
 * Trade-offs:
 * - Larger = more memory per thread, but fewer drops during bursts
 * - Memory usage = STAGING_BUFFER_SIZE Ã— number of logging threads
 *
 * For burst logging scenarios, 4-8MB is recommended.

/**
 * Thread-local staging buffer for lock-free logging.
 *
 * Memory Model:
 *   [====== committed ======][--- reserved ---][------- free -------]
 *   ^                        ^                  ^
 *   read_pos                 committed          write_pos
 *
 * Producer (logging thread):
 *   - Increments write_pos to reserve space (no lock)
 *   - Writes data
 *   - Updates committed atomically (with memory fence)
 *
 * Consumer (background thread):
 *   - Reads from read_pos up to committed
 *   - Increments read_pos after consuming
 *
 * Note: Single-producer, single-consumer model (one thread writes, background thread reads)
 *
 * Cache-Line Optimization:
 *   Fields are padded to separate cache lines to avoid false sharing.
 *   - Producer writes write_pos (own cache line)
 *   - Shared committed field (own cache line)
 *   - Consumer writes read_pos (own cache line)
